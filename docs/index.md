# Introduction

The Donut Finder API allows developers to search for donut stores, retrieve detailed information about donuts, and perform related operations with ease. This documentation provides a complete reference to help you get started quickly and use the API effectively. The API follows a REST architecture. You can access the APIâ€™s resources via HTTP requests, and responses are given in JSON format.
