## API Reference

The `donut_store` endpoint contains information about each donut shop, including its name, address, phone number, and a list of available donut types with their fillings and toppings. The `donut_type` endpoint contains information about each donut type, including its name and a list of donut shops that offer it.


The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service. When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
